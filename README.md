# Text Generation using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks

This project implements a text generation model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks. The goal is to train a GRU-based recurrent neural network on a text corpus and generate new text sequences that resemble the style and context of the training data.

## Project Overview

- **Model Used:** Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) â€” a type of recurrent neural network that is efficient for sequential data like text.
- **Task:** Character-level or word-level text generation.
- **Dataset:** A text corpus is preprocessed, tokenized, and used to train the model.
- **Output:** After training, the model can generate text by predicting the next character or word given a seed input.

## Features

- Text preprocessing including tokenization and sequence generation.
- Construction and training of a GRU-based neural network using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.
- Text generation with temperature-based sampling for diverse output.
- Visualization of training progress and loss.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
